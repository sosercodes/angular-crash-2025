# AngularCrash

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.6.

## Development

### Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

### Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## #Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## R#unning end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## The Task Tracker App


### The `*ngFor` directive

The Angular code snippet `<p *ngFor="let task of tasks">{{ task.text }}</p>` demonstrates how to use the `*ngFor` directive to dynamically generate HTML elements based on an array of data. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Directive**: 
   - `*ngFor` is a structural directive in Angular used to iterate over a list (in this case, the `tasks` array) and render a block of HTML for each item in the list.

2. **Syntax**:
   - The syntax `let task of tasks` means:
     - `task` is the variable that represents the current item in the iteration.
     - `tasks` is the array being iterated over.

3. **HTML Generation**:
   - For each item in the `tasks` array, Angular creates a new  element.
   - Inside each `` element, the value of `task.text` (a property of each object in the `tasks` array) is displayed.
